# Hero Mentality

Watching / listening to [this hvacrschool video](https://youtu.be/l3cAmW6LIns)
sparked interest w/ the `hero mentality` @ the 5 minute mark.  Made me
think a lot of myself.

Part of our character that draws us to being a tech, also seeks the
satisfaction of helping our customers, so it's often hard to not
fall into the `hero mentality`.
