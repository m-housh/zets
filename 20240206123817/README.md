# Path to Home Performance

During our symposium panel, I believe it was A-Team Adam who said the path to
getting into home performance is by doing better HVAC work.  I think this should
be explored more.

As you start to do better HVAC work, then it is a natural progression to learn
more about building science.  You will also run into problems that are just not
solvable otherwise.
