# Path to Home Performance

During our symposium panel, I believe it was A-Team Adam who said the path to
getting into home performance is by doing better HVAC work.  I think this should
be explored more.

As you start to do better HVAC work, then it is a natural progression to learn
more about building science.  You will also run into problems that are just not
solvable otherwise.

## Potential Path

It is important to understand that the path may be different for everyone.

1. Static pressure / total system airflow testing
1. Duct system renovations
1. Load calculations (really all the ACCA manuals)
1. Room x room airflow testing / balancing
1. Room pressurization (MADAir)
1. Duct testing / duct leakage to outside
1. Mold / moisture issues
