# Quit Saying So Much

Often times when we get pushback from a client we immediately start to try and
justify our pricing.  We'll often say too much or go into `child` mode.  99% of
the time this is the wrong approach.  You will achieve much more by saying less!

Learn to ask questions, dig for the real reason you are getting pushback.
This is not always easy, because it tends to be in our nature to be defensive.
On some level we often feel attacked so we go straight to defensive and then
we `lose`.

This is one of the reasons I like to be active in a lot of social-media circles
as it gives you a low-risk training ground to practice containing your emotions
and asking questions.  Social-media interactions are often how I hone in on
what questions work and what don't for given scenarios.

Bottom line make your responses short and to the point, don't over explain,
don't give away all your candy, leave room for the client to ask more, leave
them hanging a little, wanting more.
