# Data Lake

On my way home from the 2024 symposium I started thinking about data sets /
ponds / lakes. It seems that there could be some use of a way for a company to
either self-host or cloud host a database for time-series data on their
projects.  This does not necessarily help in the "communicating" type of systems
where they have to go to a proprietary dashboard, however it could be useful for
those that use ecobee or similar that the consumer could grant access to the API
data.

All of this would have to be granted by the consumer.  The data could be
anonymized so that it does not contain personal information, however may include
pertinent information about the project, house conditions, etc.

There could potentially also be a component that allows for a more public data
lake to be created / pulled from to be used in research and analysis.

I'm sure things like this exist for energy programs, etc. but they are probably
not publicly accessible, so my vision would be that this is an item that could
be used for a single company to gain insights / log their projects as well as
potentially serve the greater communities if people are willing to share the
data.
