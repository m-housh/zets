# HVACSchool Podcast

Below are the topics given by Bryan with my notes / thoughts for the podcast
scheduled to be recorded on 1/19/22.

## Proposals that create clarity (offer / refuse)

1. Have a process, use software or a template to create consistent proposals.
  1. Have some questions to ask and take notes.
  1. Not all proposals need to be fancy
  1. Think about your wording, try to avoid opinions and use facts.
  1. Try to avoid language that points to yourself (meaning mostly avoid
     statements that have 'I' or 'we')
    1. Listen to the `Eric Kaiser` in your head.
1. Have a checklist / notes to record appropriate data while on-site.
  1. Take lots of pictures
    1. Include shots of equipment from further range of view, we often take
       pictures too close and lose / miss things we may catch with a wider
       perspective on the equipment.
    1. Include link to photo album in your proposal.
      1. Google Photos
      1. Dropbox
      1. iCloud Sharing
1. Be clear on what's included and what's not.
  1. Helps to build value in your proposal.
  1. Helps client to know if they truly are getting apples / apples quotes.
1. Slow down
  1. Slowing down allows time to think about a project / proposal, even if a
     lot of the items / wording are boiler plate.
  1. Gives an opportunity to tailor the proposal / wording to reflect the
     clients wording.
  1. Most like to close on-site, however we email proposals afterward
     (your milage may vary)
1. Consider moving from a model of `offering` certain accessories to
   `including` accessories that they must `decline`.
  1. This has worked well for us.
1. Include calculations / summaries of calculations done while off-site.
  1. This is a bit slippery, and want to not give away all your candy!
1. For more in-depth proposals, I like including graphics, tables, and charts.
  1. I also include a summary which is the area I start to use 'I' and give
     my opinions.
  1. Have peers review / offer suggestions on these in-depth proposals.
  1. Include the opportunity for the client to follow-up and ask questions
    1. Limit the time / scope to do so though.
      1. "After you've had a few days to review and gather questions, let me
          know if you'd like to schedule a 30 minute conversation to help
          clarify the proposal."

## Common system replacement upgrades people miss

1. Airflow (seems like beating a dead horse)
  1. Start small, implement static pressure testing first.
  1. TrueFlow grid is a great aid and quick.
  1. Can the system handle what we're proposing?
    1. Are we going up or are we going down? Most choose up when down may be
       the better choice.
  1. Can near equipment modifications make a big difference?
1. Filtration
  1. Include better filtration and making customers decline has worked for us.
  1. How often do you see customers with those "ultra-allergen" filters??
    1. Meaning most people actually want this, we just don't offer correctly
       or don't offer at all.
1. Fresh-Air
  1. Most homes lack a controlled fresh air strategy.
  1. Doesn't hurt to offer even if you don't know how leaky the house is.
    1. Beware in high humidity climates though (maybe Bryan can chime in)
1. Surge Protectors
  1. Especially on inverters
  1. Doesn't hurt for ECM's either.
1. Dehumidifiers
  1. Especially in humid climates
1. Humidifiers
  1. In heating dominant climates.
1. IAQ Monitor
  1. Tzoa Haven
1. Water Heaters
  1. Perhaps take some time to look at other appliances while there.
1. Area specific things
  1. Is there a giant furnace / ac with a 16 x 25 filter?
  1. No box under the furnace for side / bottom airflow?
  1. Is there room for a BAD?
