# From Hero to Skeptic

Interesting how yesterday I was writing / pondering why most tech's want to be
the hero, because of the satisfaction of helping others. Today, I'm reminded
of the downsides...

It's cold AF outside, so we get bombarded with calls this morning. One of which,
was an on-call (prior to opening for the day). It was an active COVID carrier,
whom is also a maintenance customer.  Although the pandemic has been going on
for over a year, this is only our second experience with this scenario, so we
were scrambling a little to figure out the proper protocol.  We didn't want to
expose our techs, but realized our duty (I mean the nurses and doctors on the
front-lines have WAY more exposure than us).

I decided that I should run the call.  Our original thought was we should ask
them to leave for a few hours and we would come while gone. The customers are
aging (how old is a guess, but old) and at the same time when sick leaving sucks!
We asked them to isolate the infected in a separate room while we were on-site
and to open all doors, etc. to clear the path to the equipment and limit our
exposure.

I arrive, the individual who is sick is sitting in kitchen (not really an
isolated room, but far enough away).  While trying to maintain my distance,
I allow the healthy member of the house open up / show me where the equipment
is located.  I find the problem (bad igniter), have to make a few trips to the
truck, the sick member meanwhile asks me something everytime I come up the steps,
is hacking / coughing most of the time, did not have a mask on (although I did,
as well as gloves).  Which I just accepted, but what really pissed me off is
that when I was done and explaining the repair / asking if there were any
questions the sick chimed in (while coughing) that **I** needed to set the thermostat.
I kindly explained that "I would prefer to touch your stuff as little as
possible, because we have a lot of other clients that I come in contact with
that also may be at risk." Although I looked at the stat and instructed the
healthy member of the household how to set it appropriately (which they knew).

Anyway, this is longer than usual, but sometimes we take for granted or deny
what we are exposing others to.  Because the sick felt they were "almost
over" their virus that it was fine to be careless with those they rely on
for tasks they can not do, with a lack of consideration...  They didn't care
that I have a family, a girlfriend who is recovering from surgery, selfishness
reigns supreme!

I only say this, so that I may take this to heart, and perhaps think a little
bit more, be a little less selfish, and at least consider what role my
actions have on others.
