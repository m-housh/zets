# A Living HVAC/Home-Comfort Document

There should be a place for further education for consumers on advanced HVAC
and Home-Comfort issues.  I say this should be a living document so that it is
flexible and can be updated more easily as data / testing becomes more available.

Perhaps this should be a website, a series of articles, a blog? Not really sure,
but there needs to be an opposition / alternative.  Preferably licensed under
Creative Commons or similar.

This is not the same a policy / field procedure, more of a consumer facing /
friendly format.  More in-depth items can / should live and breathe separately
although closely related.
