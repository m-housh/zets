This document provides links to documents on IAQ, primarily researching for clarify the meaning of ACH of outside air vs. recirculated air
inside a residential building.

- [IAQ and energy implications of high efficiency filters in residential buildings](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/23744731.2018.1526012?needAccess=true) -
  - Examination of the long-term performance of higher efficiency filters in this article suggests caution in the application of the
    assumption that higher efficiency filters perform better than lower efficiency filters and always have positive health and economic
    benefits.
  - Cost Benefit ratio is higher in office buildings because the population density vs. ft^2 is higher, and people spend less time in an
    office.
  - Commercial buildings often have mechanical ventilation that passes through a filter.
  - Residential is affected because of shorter equipment runtimes.
  - Residential health benefits range from 1-@1300 per / year.

  - Comparetto Cube / Corsi-Rosenthal Box
- [Engineering tips forum](https://www.eng-tips.com/threads/air-changes-an-hour-confusion.473343/)
  - Some standards use ACH to describe outdoor air and others use it to describe a mix of outdoor air + recirculated air.

- [EPA how much ventilation do I need](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/how-much-ventilation-do-i-need-my-home-improve-indoor-air-quality)
  - 0.35 ACH, but not less than 15 CFM per person
- [Contracting Business, Rob Falke article](https://www.contractingbusiness.com/service/article/21133838/steps-to-calculate-air-changes-and-air-exchanges-per-hour)
  - Defines ACH as the total air changes (recirculated and outside air)
  - Defines AEH as only fresh air
- [Contracting Business, Room CFM using ACH](https://www.contractingbusiness.com/service/article/20868246/use-the-air-changes-calculation-to-determine-room-cfm)
  - Has similar chart showing recommended air changes as my article
  - Article also by Rob Falke
- [US Green Building Council](https://www.usgbc.org/credits/existing-buildings/v5-public-comment-1-18)
  - Includes IAQ limits / thresholds.
- [Engineering Toolbox Air Change Rates in Rooms and Buildings](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-change-rate-room-d_867.html)
  - Uses as volume of fresh air (make up air)
