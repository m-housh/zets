# Measure Quick Testimonial

I have used MeasureQuick since it's early days.  I have always known that good software can,
and should, augment the way that we do business in the trades, but there had never been really good
software for technicians in the field.  Most of the HVAC software is centered around business
operations (CRM, Accounting, etc.) or design (Manual-J, Manual-D, etc.).  Those softwares are important,
don't get me wrong, however for technicians in the field, there has never been a more powerful tool than
what MeasureQuick offers.

The ability to unify and communicate with the awesome selection of connected tools that are available
on the market today is one of the pieces that has been most important to myself.  The integrations allow
me to only have to familiarize myself with the intricacies of the MeasureQuick platform instead of
fumbling around with the tool manufacturer's software (which to be honest is generally not what they're good
at, they're good at making tools).

For my business, I can trust that my technicians are following a proper workflow / protocol.  We used to have
massive checklists for our maintenance members because I always wanted to offer a streamlined / similar experience,
no matter the technician that was at my customers home that day.  MeasureQuick allowed us to consolidate that into an
application that not only gathers the metrics needed, but also can help point less seasoned technicians to problems
they may have glossed over, as well as provide a beautiful report that proves the measurements that we took
while on site.

As a business owner it is often hard to know what areas your staff may need more training in.  Since
I am also in the field the majority of the time, looking back at past reports allows me to see what
"flags" are being repeatedly ignored / overlooked and allows training to be tailored to the specific
topics that seem most important to the way I want my business to operate.

Over the years the power of the software has grown, now with the integration into House
Call Pro (the CRM software that we use), integrations with the TrueFlow Grid for airflow measurements,
and the Sauermann combustion analyzers means that all of our workflows, from the day of an install to the
years of maintenance thereafter, can be ran inside of the MeasureQuick platform and sync with our customer history.
