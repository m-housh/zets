# Multi-Fan Blower Door Test

Notes for conducting multi-fan blower door testing on large structures.

## Setup

1. Only one gauge has a reference to outdoors.

## Testing

1. Start secondary fan first and get up to full speed, check pressure on
   primary gauge / fan.
    1. If pressure is 50Pa or greater only one fan is needed.
1. Start primary fan with flow rings in-place to prevent from running backwards.
1. Numbers are added together to get the total CFM50 leakage.
