# zets

Repository for `Zettelkasten` notes.

Musings from an HVAC nerd!

This is inspired (stolen)  from `rwxrob`'s method of `Zettelkasten`.  Each note (`zet`) is stored in a directory
created from the `isosec` of when the `zet` was created.  Each directory contains a `README.md` file and any assets
required by the file are stored in an `assets` directory.

The `zet`'s are typically (or should be) short preferably under 25-30 lines, written in `Common Mark` and don't
include any `html`.

## Warning

These notes are my personal public notes, they will be messy, may not make sense to you, may include foul language,
and will change overtime.

It is fine to quote use snippets of these `zet`'s however pull-requests and issues will likely be ignored.  There
should be no changes permitted to the original work.
