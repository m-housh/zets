# Multi-Fan Blower Door TEC Call Notes

Know you have a zone when you take a gauge and have a pressure difference
between the floor in question, if difference is greater than 10% (5Pa) you're
not measuring fully.

2 Solutions, but a fan in that area and let it cruise at 50.  If no way to get
to the outside with the fan, see if there's a spot to put the fan on the floor
to boost / help get the flow back to the fans.

Cruise both of them, but only use second fan if needed.

Actually we think that cruising only one fan.

Make sure taps are not in the air streams, bc of turbulence it may be worth
connecting hoses to open ports.

Use tubing assistant on where the gauges / hoses should be in pressurization
mode.

When you go to record the reading, you can change to 10 second average so that
there's less bouncing in the gauge.

If you change to long-term averaging make sure to change back to 1-10 seconds.

Open-a-hole method to try to get better understanding of the leakage of the
certain zones.
