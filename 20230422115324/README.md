# Is HVAC Stuck In The Stoneage

It is known that there are plenty of companies out there that don't have a
firm grasp on the basics.  There are a lot of trainers and orginizations
focused on those topics.  I often wonder how daunting it must feel to just
have to train the same topics over and over, often times to the same people
over and over without much movement.


## Questions to explore

- What motivates these trainers to continue the training we obviously need so
desperately?
- How do they find inspiration?
- How do they make things exciting?
  1. Ty Branaman (good example)
- How do they make it marketable / profitable to do their job?
  1. NCI (good example)
  1. Also free resources that don't necessarily need funding to survive (HVAC School)
- How do we engage upper tier / influencers?
  1. How do we inspire them to come up with the "next big thing"
  1. What trainings / classes do they need
  1. What are ways they implement / do new things without sinking the ship
  1. How to empower them to explore their ideas
- Why companies (including training organizations) aren't leveraging technology beyond basic CRM stuff?

## Ramblings

There seems to be a gap between the 1%er's / innovators in the industry versus the traditional
contractors / way of doing things.  The real innovators are often times smaller / more flexible.
It is easier for them to stay fluent and explore new things. As a company scales, you have to feed
the machine, so it's harder to turn the ship quickly without fear of sinking.

I don't like thinking / saying that my skill level is above others (aside from a joking context), but
this "gap" is becoming ever wider and more evident.  The pool of those that give me hope / inspiration
shrinks.  It remains easy to just stay stagnant or complain about where other folks are.  How do you
balance the fact that someone at a different level could potentially gain insights from those that implement
things at much higher / different level, but you're tired of the same old conversations?

During conferences / trainings most of the magic happens around the water cooler in-between the actual
classes. A lot of relationships are built there.  That is where we can peek inside the curtain of someone.
Sometimes you reveal / see a lot of potential, other times you realize that a person is really just a money
hungry asshole and isn't worth my time (let them play with the other money hungry assholes).

## More Questions

- How can conferences allow more time for water cooler conversations to happen?
- What does that format look like?
- How can there also be a path for those at a higher level already?

If I have to take another static pressure class, I think I may scream!
